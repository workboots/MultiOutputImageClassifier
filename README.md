# README

This is a project to test a general multi-output CNN for classifying pictures according to the clothe type such as 'dress', 'shirt', 'shoes', etc. as well as according to their colour.

This is just a method of learning how to design CNNs with branches and having multiple outputs and multiple loss functions.

This work is primarily replicated from PyImageSearch and the link can be found [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/04/keras-multiple-outputs-and-multiple-losses/).

The data will be self-generated, once again following a tutorial on PyImageSearch on how to use the Bing Image Search API to create datasets. The link to the tutorial can be found [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/04/09/how-to-quickly-build-a-deep-learning-image-dataset/)
